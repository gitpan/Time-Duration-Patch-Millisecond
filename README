NAME
    Time::Duration::Patch::Millisecond - Make Time::Duration support
    millisecond

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     # patch first before importing! otherwise you'll get unpatched version
     use Time::Duration::Patch::Millisecond;

     use Time::Duration;

     say ago(0.3); # => 300 milliseconds ago
     say concise(duration(2.03)); # => 2s30ms

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains patch for Time::Duration to support millisecond. I
    am also in the process of asking Time::Duration's whether he/she wants
    to merge this into Time::Duration. See Time::Duration's RT queue [1].

    Locale modules might want to translate 'millisecond(s)' and provide its
    concise version as well.
