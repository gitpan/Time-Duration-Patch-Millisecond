NAME
    Time::Duration::Patch::Millisecond - Make Time::Duration support
    milliseconds

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     # patch first before importing! otherwise you'll get unpatched version
     use Time::Duration::Patch::Millisecond;

     use Time::Duration;

     say ago(0.3); # => 300 milliseconds ago
     say concise(duration(2.03)); # => 2s30ms

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains patch for Time::Duration to support milliseconds. I
    am also in the process of asking Time::Duration's maintainer whether
    he/she wants to merge this into Time::Duration. See RT#81960.

    Locale modules like Time::Duration::id or Time::Duration::fr might want
    to translate 'millisecond(s)' and provide its concise version as well.
